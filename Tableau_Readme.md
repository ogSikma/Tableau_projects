## KENDRICK LAMAR
**Dashboard showcasing the achievements of popular American rapper Kendrick Lamar.**
The visualization shows the awards and other accolades the artist has received over the years, as well as the most popular songs from his official albums.

Two datasets were used, the first available on Kaggle:
www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/kendrick-lamar-discography/versions/1?resource=download
*Containing data on the discography (without information on popularity, i.e. the number of listens on the Spotify platform - I have added by myself, actual at 19.02.2025)*

And a second dataset, created by myself, containing the most important achievements and awards over the years.

The visualization includes basic information about the player's statistics and strongly focuses on his throwing efficiency - it illustrates a map of shots made and visualizes the type and frequency of throws. There was also added a timeline with played games.
The dataset used was created by myself using data available at https://www.nbasavant.com
